/*!
 * Main thread message handler function
 *
 *  Create functions of this type in order to handle messages from the realtime thread
 *  on the main thread. You then pass a pointer to these functions when using
 *  @link AEMessageQueue::AEMessageQueueSendMessageToMainThread AEMessageQueueSendMessageToMainThread @endlink 
 *  on the realtime thread, along with data to pass through via the userInfo parameter.
 *
 *  See @link AEMessageQueue::AEMessageQueueSendMessageToMainThread AEMessageQueueSendMessageToMainThread @endlink
 *  for further discussion.
 *
 * @param userInfo          Pointer to your data
 * @param userInfoLength    Length of userInfo in bytes

/*!
 * Message Queue
 *
 *  This class manages a two-way message queue which is used to pass messages back and
 *  forth between the realtime thread and other threads in your app. This provides for
 *  an easy lock-free synchronization method, which is important when working with audio.
 *
 *  @link AEAudioController @endlink contains its own instance of this class, and it's
 *  best to simply use that. However, you can create your own instance and use it to
 *  perform actions at particular intervals, such as on beat boundaries.

 *
 *  If provided, the response block will be called on the main thread after the message has
 *  been processed on the realtime thread. You may exchange information from the realtime thread to 
 *  the main thread via a shared data structure (such as a struct, allocated on the heap in advance), 
 *  or a __block variable.

/*!
 * Send a message to the main thread asynchronously
 *
 *  This is a synchronization mechanism that allows the realtime thread to schedule actions to be performed
 *  on the main thread, without any locking or memory allocation.  Pass in a function pointer and
 *  optionally a pointer to data to be copied and passed to the handler, and the function will 
 *  be called on the main thread at the next polling interval.
 *
 *  Tip: To pass a pointer (including pointers to __unsafe_unretained Objective-C objects) through the 
 *  userInfo parameter, be sure to pass the address to the pointer, using the "&" prefix:
 *
 *  @code
 *  AEMessageQueueSendMessageToMainThread(queue, myMainThreadFunction, &pointer, sizeof(void*));
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  or
 *
 *  @code
 *  AEMessageQueueSendMessageToMainThread(queue, myMainThreadFunction, &object, sizeof(MyObject*));
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  You can then retrieve the pointer value via a void** dereference from your function:
 *
 *  @code
 *  void * myPointerValue = *(void**)userInfo;
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  To access an Objective-C object pointer, you also need to bridge the pointer value:
 *
 *  @code
 *  MyObject *object = (__bridge MyObject*)*(void**)userInfo;
 *  @endcode
 *
 * @param messageQueue    The message queue instance.
 * @param handler         A pointer to a function to call on the main thread.
 * @param userInfo        Pointer to user info data to pass to handler - this will be copied.
 * @param userInfoLength  Length of userInfo in bytes.
